        Nature is everything around us that is not created by humans. It includes trees, plants, animals, birds, mountains, rivers, oceans, air, water, and sunlight.
         Nature supports life on Earth by providing essential resources such as food, water, and oxygen. It maintains balance in the ecosystem and helps all living beings survive.
          Nature also gives peace to the human mind and plays an important role in keeping the environment healthy. 
        Protecting nature is essential because our life and future depend on it.

    <p>
        Our responsibility is to protect and care for nature and the environment. 
        As humans, we depend on nature for air, water, food, and shelter, so it is our duty to preserve it for future generations.
         We should plant trees, save water, reduce pollution, avoid plastic, and protect wildlife and their habitats. Small actions like recycling waste, using eco-friendly products, and spreading awareness can make a big difference. 
        By fulfilling our responsibility towards nature, we help create a healthier and more sustainable world.
